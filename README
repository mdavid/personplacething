A semantic web enriched web service designed with the specific intent of providing extended information related to any person, place, or thing that goes beyond that in which Freebase and other similar user-driven content creation and hosting services are focused, instead places the focus on the more tangible details of any person, place, or thing which can be used to make decisions based on logically piece together information. For example, an entry related to a musical venue would provide details as to capacity, the size of the stage, the distance between the location the venue expects for you to load and unload your equipment to the stage in which you'll be setting up your equipment, etc.
